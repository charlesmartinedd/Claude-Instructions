## 🚀 SCALING PROTOCOL - GETTING TO THE BREAD

**Who We Are**: Charles Martin and Dr. Marie Martin are educational technology entrepreneurs who co-founded Alexandria's Design, a consulting business transforming how schools adapt to the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Charles brings deep expertise in AI orchestration, multi-agent workflows, and edtech product development (including ModelIt! for K-12 students), while Dr. Marie Martin contributes 25+ years of educational leadership, curriculum development, and instructional design across K-12, higher education, government, and military sectors. Together, they're building innovative educational platforms that integrate cutting-edge AI with human-centered design, creating scalable solutions for professional development, customized learning, and interactive educational experiences.

**Our Purpose**: We're building Alexandria's Design to achieve unlimited monthly recurring revenue—no ceiling, just growth. We create educational technology solutions that transform learning while generating passive income through automation, reusable assets, and productized services. Every project we undertake should move us closer to systems that serve unlimited clients simultaneously and scale without proportional time investment. We're not building a lifestyle business—we're building a revenue engine.

**What We're About**: Alexandria's Design helps schools, districts, and educational organizations embrace future-ready practices through professional development, workshops, customized learning solutions, and AI-integrated educational experiences. We specialize in turning complex educational challenges into scalable, automated solutions that blend Dr. Marie's deep educational expertise with Charles's technical innovation. Our focus is on creating reusable, high-quality assets that can be deployed across multiple clients, ensuring both educational impact and business scalability.

**How We Work**: When we approach any project, we think revenue-first: Does this generate income? Can it scale infinitely? Is it reusable? Can it be automated? We prioritize building systems over completing one-off tasks, creating templates over custom solutions, and developing passive income streams over hourly work. Charles's time and Dr. Marie's expertise are our most valuable resources, so we focus on strategic, high-value creation while automating everything else. We're not just completing tasks—we're building an unlimited revenue engine. Let's get to the bread.

## 🔄 N8N WORKFLOW AUTOMATION - ALWAYS ACTIVE MCP SERVER

**Status**: ✅ MCP Server Always Active
**Docker Container**: Running on port 5678
**Web Access**: http://localhost:5678
**MCP Tools**: 23+ n8n workflow tools available via Claude Code

### Critical Operating Principle: NO GUI ALLOWED

**Charles does NOT use the n8n GUI**. All workflow automation MUST be built programmatically via:
1. n8n MCP tools (primary method - use these first)
2. n8n REST API via PowerShell/terminal
3. Direct workflow JSON manipulation

**NEVER** suggest opening the browser or using the web interface.

### N8N MCP Server Configuration

The n8n-MCP server is **permanently enabled** in `.claude/mcp_settings.json`:
- Provides 23+ tools for workflow creation and management
- Access to 541 n8n node types with documentation
- Smart node search and configuration examples
- Real-time workflow validation

**API Key Setup** (one-time requirement for full functionality):
```powershell
# Run the helper script to get/create API key
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "scripts/n8n-automation/get-n8n-api-key.ps1"

# Or with credentials for automatic creation:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "scripts/n8n-automation/get-n8n-api-key.ps1" -username "your@email.com" -password "yourpassword"
```

After obtaining the API key, add it to `.env`:
```
N8N_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Available N8N MCP Tools

When the MCP server is active, you have access to these tools via Claude Code:
- **Workflow Management**: Create, read, update, delete workflows
- **Node Discovery**: Search 541+ n8n node types
- **Configuration**: Get node parameters and examples
- **Execution**: Trigger and monitor workflow runs
- **Templates**: Access pre-built workflow patterns

### External API Policy

**Priority Order for Integrations**:
1. **First**: Use n8n's built-in nodes (no external APIs needed)
2. **Second**: Use already-authenticated services (Google Workspace, Office 365, OpenAI, OpenRouter)
3. **Third**: Use local services (PostgreSQL, Redis, MySQL, MongoDB)
4. **Last Resort Only**: Suggest free API signups from external companies

Only recommend new API integrations as an absolute last resort.

### Already Available for N8N Workflows

**No New APIs Needed**:
- **Google Workspace**: Gmail, Drive, Sheets, Docs, Calendar, Slides (authenticated)
- **Office 365**: Outlook, Teams, OneDrive, SharePoint, Planner (authenticated)
- **OpenAI**: GPT models, DALL-E, Whisper (API key configured)
- **OpenRouter**: 300+ LLMs (API key configured)
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL (port 5432), MySQL (ports 3308, 3309), MongoDB (port 27018)
- **Redis**: Available on ports 6382, 6383
- **HTTP/Webhooks**: No auth required
- **File System**: Direct file operations
- **JavaScript/Python**: Code execution within n8n

### Workflow Building Process

When Charles requests an n8n workflow:

1. **Use MCP Tools First**: Leverage the n8n-MCP tools to search nodes, get configs, and build workflows
2. **Check Available Integrations**: Prioritize services already authenticated
3. **Build Programmatically**: Create workflow JSON via MCP tools or PowerShell
4. **No GUI**: Never suggest browser access
5. **Test & Deploy**: Execute and validate programmatically

### Example: Creating a Workflow via MCP Tools

```
When Charles says: "Create an n8n workflow that sends Gmail notifications to Slack"

Your response should use n8n MCP tools to:
1. Search for Gmail and Slack nodes
2. Get configuration examples for each node
3. Build the workflow structure
4. Deploy via MCP tools
5. Test execution

Never say: "Open n8n at localhost:5678 and..."
Always say: "I'll use the n8n MCP tools to build this workflow programmatically..."
```

### Helper Scripts Location

**Path**: `scripts/n8n-automation/`

**Available Scripts**:
- `get-n8n-api-key.ps1` - Get or create n8n API key (no GUI)
- `create-workflow.ps1` - Template for workflow creation (to be created as needed)
- `list-workflows.ps1` - List all workflows (to be created as needed)
- `execute-workflow.ps1` - Trigger workflow runs (to be created as needed)

### Integration with Scaling Strategy

n8n is **CRITICAL** for Alexandria's Design revenue scaling:
- **Client Onboarding**: Automated welcome sequences
- **Lead Nurturing**: Email drip campaigns
- **Data Pipelines**: Form submissions to databases
- **Team Coordination**: Automated notifications and updates
- **Content Distribution**: Multi-platform publishing
- **Revenue Tracking**: Automated reporting and analytics
- **Course Delivery**: Student progress tracking and communications

Every automation Charles requests should be evaluated for n8n implementation to maximize scalability and minimize ongoing time investment.

### Key Reminder

The n8n MCP server is **always active** and **always available**. Use it as your primary method for building workflow automation. Build in code, deploy via terminal, scale infinitely.

## 📸 SCREENSHOT REFERENCES

**Default Location**: `C:\Users\MarieLexisDad\Pictures\Screenshots`

### Automatic Screenshot Handling

When the user references a screenshot in conversation:
1. Check the Screenshots folder for the most recent file(s)
2. Use the Read tool to view the screenshot
3. Analyze the image content to understand the user's reference

**Example user references:**
- "Look at the screenshot I just took"
- "Can you check that error in the screenshot?"
- "See what I mean in the image"

**How to handle:**
```bash
# List recent screenshots (sorted by modification time, newest first)
dir "C:\Users\MarieLexisDad\Pictures\Screenshots" /O-D /B

# View the most recent screenshot
Read "C:\Users\MarieLexisDad\Pictures\Screenshots\[filename]"
```

**Key Points:**
- Always check for the most recently modified screenshot when user makes a vague reference
- Screenshots are viewable using the Read tool (supports PNG, JPG, etc.)
- If multiple screenshots exist, show the most recent or ask for clarification

## 🚨 CRITICAL: CONCURRENT EXECUTION & FILE MANAGEMENT

**ABSOLUTE RULES**:
1. ALL operations MUST be concurrent/parallel in a single message
2. **NEVER save working files, text/mds and tests to the root folder**
3. ALWAYS organize files in appropriate subdirectories
4. **USE CLAUDE CODE'S TASK TOOL** for spawning agents concurrently, not just MCP

### ⚡ GOLDEN RULE: "1 MESSAGE = ALL RELATED OPERATIONS"

**MANDATORY PATTERNS:**
- **TodoWrite**: ALWAYS batch ALL todos in ONE call (5-10+ todos minimum)
- **Task tool (Claude Code)**: ALWAYS spawn ALL agents in ONE message with full instructions
- **File operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL reads/writes/edits in ONE message
- **Bash commands**: ALWAYS batch ALL terminal operations in ONE message
- **Memory operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL memory store/retrieve in ONE message

### 🎯 CRITICAL: Claude Code Task Tool for Agent Execution

**Claude Code's Task tool is the PRIMARY way to spawn agents:**
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT: Use Claude Code's Task tool for parallel agent execution
[Single Message]:
  Task("Research agent", "Analyze requirements and patterns...", "researcher")
  Task("Coder agent", "Implement core features...", "coder")
  Task("Tester agent", "Create comprehensive tests...", "tester")
  Task("Reviewer agent", "Review code quality...", "reviewer")
  Task("Architect agent", "Design system architecture...", "system-architect")
```

**MCP tools are ONLY for coordination setup:**
- `mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init` - Initialize coordination topology
- `mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn` - Define agent types for coordination
- `mcp__claude-flow__task_orchestrate` - Orchestrate high-level workflows

### 📁 File Organization Rules

**NEVER save to root folder. Use these directories:**
- `/src` - Source code files
- `/tests` - Test files
- `/docs` - Documentation and markdown files
- `/config` - Configuration files
- `/scripts` - Utility scripts
- `/examples` - Example code

## Project Overview

This project uses SPARC (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion) methodology with Claude-Flow orchestration for systematic Test-Driven Development.

## SPARC Commands

## 🎯 Claude Code vs MCP Tools

### Claude Code Handles ALL EXECUTION:
- **Task tool**: Spawn and run agents concurrently for actual work
- File operations (Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Glob, Grep)
- Code generation and programming
- Bash commands and system operations
- Implementation work
- Project navigation and analysis
- TodoWrite and task management
- Git operations
- Package management
- Testing and debugging

### MCP Tools ONLY COORDINATE:
- Swarm initialization (topology setup)
- Agent type definitions (coordination patterns)
- Task orchestration (high-level planning)
- Memory management
- Neural features
- Performance tracking
- GitHub integration

**KEY**: MCP coordinates the strategy, Claude Code's Task tool executes with real agents.

## 🚀 MCP Server Configuration

**Auto-loads on startup** (already configured in `.claude/mcp_settings.json`):
- ✅ Google Workspace (Gmail, Drive, Calendar, Docs, Sheets, Slides)
- ✅ Office 365 (Outlook, Teams, Planner, OneDrive, SharePoint)

**Optional MCPs** (load only when requested):
```bash
# Load these ONLY when specifically needed
# Currently set to disabled: true in mcp_settings.json

# Claude Flow - Swarm coordination and neural training
# To enable: Edit .claude/mcp_settings.json, set "disabled": false for claude-flow
claude mcp add claude-flow npx claude-flow@alpha mcp start

# RUV Swarm - Enhanced coordination (optional)
claude mcp add ruv-swarm npx ruv-swarm mcp start

# Flow Nexus - Cloud features (optional)
claude mcp add flow-nexus npx flow-nexus@latest mcp start
```

**To disable Claude Flow** (per user preference):
Edit `.claude/mcp_settings.json` and set `"disabled": true` for the `claude-flow` entry.

## 🚀 Agent Execution Flow with Claude Code

### The Correct Pattern:

1. **Optional**: Use MCP tools to set up coordination topology
2. **REQUIRED**: Use Claude Code's Task tool to spawn agents that do actual work
3. **REQUIRED**: Each agent runs hooks for coordination
4. **REQUIRED**: Batch all operations in single messages

### Example Full-Stack Development:

```javascript
// Single message with all agent spawning via Claude Code's Task tool
[Parallel Agent Execution]:
  Task("Backend Developer", "Build REST API with Express. Use hooks for coordination.", "backend-dev")
  Task("Frontend Developer", "Create React UI. Coordinate with backend via memory.", "coder")
  Task("Database Architect", "Design PostgreSQL schema. Store schema in memory.", "code-analyzer")
  Task("Test Engineer", "Write Jest tests. Check memory for API contracts.", "tester")
  Task("DevOps Engineer", "Setup Docker and CI/CD. Document in memory.", "cicd-engineer")
  Task("Security Auditor", "Review authentication. Report findings via hooks.", "reviewer")
  
  // All todos batched together
  TodoWrite { todos: [...8-10 todos...] }
  
  // All file operations together
  Write "backend/server.js"
  Write "frontend/App.jsx"
  Write "database/schema.sql"
```

## 📋 Agent Coordination Protocol

### Every Agent Spawned via Task Tool MUST:

**1️⃣ BEFORE Work:**
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description "[task]"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-restore --session-id "swarm-[id]"
```

**2️⃣ DURING Work:**
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-edit --file "[file]" --memory-key "swarm/[agent]/[step]"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks notify --message "[what was done]"
```

**3️⃣ AFTER Work:**
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "[task]"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-end --export-metrics true
```

## 🎯 Concurrent Execution Examples

### ✅ CORRECT WORKFLOW: MCP Coordinates, Claude Code Executes

```javascript
// Step 1: MCP tools set up coordination (optional, for complex tasks)
[Single Message - Coordination Setup]:
  mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init { topology: "mesh", maxAgents: 6 }
  mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "researcher" }
  mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "coder" }
  mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { type: "tester" }

// Step 2: Claude Code Task tool spawns ACTUAL agents that do the work
[Single Message - Parallel Agent Execution]:
  // Claude Code's Task tool spawns real agents concurrently
  Task("Research agent", "Analyze API requirements and best practices. Check memory for prior decisions.", "researcher")
  Task("Coder agent", "Implement REST endpoints with authentication. Coordinate via hooks.", "coder")
  Task("Database agent", "Design and implement database schema. Store decisions in memory.", "code-analyzer")
  Task("Tester agent", "Create comprehensive test suite with 90% coverage.", "tester")
  Task("Reviewer agent", "Review code quality and security. Document findings.", "reviewer")
  
  // Batch ALL todos in ONE call
  TodoWrite { todos: [
    {id: "1", content: "Research API patterns", status: "in_progress", priority: "high"},
    {id: "2", content: "Design database schema", status: "in_progress", priority: "high"},
    {id: "3", content: "Implement authentication", status: "pending", priority: "high"},
    {id: "4", content: "Build REST endpoints", status: "pending", priority: "high"},
    {id: "5", content: "Write unit tests", status: "pending", priority: "medium"},
    {id: "6", content: "Integration tests", status: "pending", priority: "medium"},
    {id: "7", content: "API documentation", status: "pending", priority: "low"},
    {id: "8", content: "Performance optimization", status: "pending", priority: "low"}
  ]}
  
  // Parallel file operations
  Bash "mkdir -p app/{src,tests,docs,config}"
  Write "app/package.json"
  Write "app/src/server.js"
  Write "app/tests/server.test.js"
  Write "app/docs/API.md"
```

### ❌ WRONG (Multiple Messages):
```javascript
Message 1: mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init
Message 2: Task("agent 1")
Message 3: TodoWrite { todos: [single todo] }
Message 4: Write "file.js"
// This breaks parallel coordination!
```
